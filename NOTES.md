# Notes

- Everyone pushes their calendar to the server
- Server finds time where everyone in group is free, shows free calendar spots to all users
- Multiple groups could be created
- Enter your email or username to find friends


For now we'll be supporting iCloud/Google.

- For Google Calendars to be accessable publicly you'll need to create a new calendar (title it something like "Friends"), and [set permissions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37083?hl=en).
